# eCommerce Website

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a fully functional **eCommerce website** built from scratch using **Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS**. The project showcases my ability to create a high-performance, scalable, and responsive UI **without relying on any UI library**, emphasizing my raw coding skills in React and Tailwind CSS.

## Key Highlights
- ❌ **No State Management Library Used** – This project does not use Redux, Zustand, or any other state management solution.
- ❌ **No UI Library Used** – The UI is built purely with Tailwind CSS without libraries like MUI, Ant Design, or ShadCN.
- ❌ **No YouTube Tutorials Used** – The project was built from scratch without relying on YouTube guides.

## 🎯 Features
- 🛒 **Product Listing Page** – Displays a dynamic list of products.
- 🔍 **Search & Filtering** – Allows users to search and filter products efficiently.
- 🛍 **Shopping Cart** – Users can add, update, and remove items from their cart.
- 💳 **Checkout Process** – Seamless checkout flow.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** – Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- ⚡ **Optimized Performance** – Built with Vite for blazing-fast development and production builds.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
